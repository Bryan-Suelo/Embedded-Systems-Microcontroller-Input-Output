# **Chapter 1 - Introduction** 

## **Description and Impact**
An embedded system combines mechanical, electrical, and chemical components along with a computer, hidden inside, to perform a single dedicated purpose.
Most computers are single-chip microcontrollers that are the brains of an embedded system.

## **Approach**
Embedded systems afford an effective platform to teach new engineers how to program for three reasons.
1. There is no operating system. Thus, in a bottom-up fashion the student can see, write, and understand all software running on a system that actually does something.
2. Embedded systems involve real input/output that is easy for the student to touch, hear, and see
3. Embedded systems are employed in many every-day products.
